  =============================================
  HOW TO EDIT (read me!)
  =============================================
  • This is a single-file static site (index.html). Drop it in a GitHub repository and enable GitHub Pages.
  • Everything is pure HTML/CSS/JS — no frameworks, no builds.
  • To add or edit articles, scroll to the bottom and update the `ARTICLES` array in the <script>.
    - Each article has: id, title, slug, era, tags (array), summary, content (HTML allowed), sources (array of {label, url}).
    - Keep `slug` URL-friendly (lowercase-with-dashes). The page route is `#/article/<slug>`.
  • The left sidebar shows sections (Home, All Articles, Eras, Tags). Search is at the top.
  • Styling uses CSS variables; tweak the palette in :root for quick theming.
  • Optional light/dark theme toggle in the header.

        content: `
            <h2>Early Life (1963–late 1970s)</h2>
            <p><strong>Kevin David Mitnick</strong> was born on <strong>August 6, 1963</strong>, in Los Angeles, California. Growing up in the San Fernando Valley, he showed an early fascination with systems and persuasion. At age 12, he famously learned to ride L.A. buses for free by using discarded transfer slips and a ticket punch he obtained by charming a bus driver—an early lesson in <em>social engineering</em>.</p>

            <h2>First Hacks & Phone Phreaking</h2>
            <p>In his teens, Mitnick gravitated to the phone-phreaking scene, exploring how signaling, switches, and operators worked. He became a licensed amateur radio operator and honed skills that blended technical curiosity with psychological manipulation—calling employees, imitating tech staff, and asking the right questions to gain access.</p>

            <h2>DEC Case and Early Conviction (1979–1988)</h2>
            <p>At 16, Mitnick accessed Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) systems and copied proprietary software used to develop RSTS/E. He was ultimately charged and in <strong>1988</strong> sentenced to <strong>12 months in prison</strong> and <strong>3 years of supervised release</strong> for the DEC intrusion.</p>

            <h2>Probation Violations & Going Fugitive (1992–1995)</h2>
            <p>Near the end of supervised release, he was accused of accessing <strong>Pacific Bell</strong> systems and other networks, prompting a warrant. Mitnick fled and lived as a fugitive for around <strong>2½ years</strong>, using cloned cell phones, multiple aliases, and security tradecraft to evade capture while allegedly obtaining source code and credentials from major companies.</p>

            <h2>The Shimomura Pursuit & Arrest (Dec 1994–Feb 1995)</h2>
            <p>On <strong>Christmas Day 1994</strong>, security researcher <strong>Tsutomu Shimomura</strong> found his systems compromised via spoofing and began assisting law enforcement in tracing the intruder. After a high-profile chase, the <strong>FBI arrested Mitnick on February 15, 1995</strong>, in <strong>Raleigh, North Carolina</strong>, following an “intensive two-week electronic manhunt.”</p>

            <h2>Charges, Solitary, and Sentencing</h2>
            <p>Mitnick faced multiple counts, including wire fraud and unauthorized access. During pre-trial, he spent roughly <strong>8 months in solitary confinement</strong>, fueled by a myth that he could trigger national defense systems “by whistling” into a phone. He ultimately <strong>pleaded guilty</strong> and served about <strong>46 months</strong> (roughly five years including pre-trial time), followed by supervised release.</p>

            <h2>Reinvention: Consultant, Author, Speaker (2000s–2010s)</h2>
            <p>After release in 2000, Mitnick transitioned to a legal career in security: founding <strong>Mitnick Security Consulting</strong>, advising enterprises, and becoming <strong>Chief Hacking Officer at KnowBe4</strong>. He co-authored influential books bridging psychology and security, including <em>The Art of Deception</em> (2002), <em>The Art of Intrusion</em> (2005), memoir <em>Ghost in the Wires</em> (2011), and <em>The Art of Invisibility</em> (2017). He popularized social-engineering awareness through live demos and keynote talks.</p>

            <h2>Death and Legacy</h2>
            <p>Mitnick <strong>died on July 16, 2023</strong>, at age 59, after a <strong>14-month battle with pancreatic cancer</strong>. Reports noted he passed at a Pittsburgh hospital while under treatment. He is remembered as both a symbol of 1990s hacker culture’s excesses and a pioneer who helped professionalize security, pushing organizations to take human-factor defenses seriously.</p>

        content: `
          <p>The origins of the term <strong>'hacker'</strong> in a computing context trace back to MIT's <strong>Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC)</strong> in the late 1950s. The club built an immensely complex model railroad system, wired with hundreds of relays and switches. Members who created clever, elegant, and efficient solutions to complex electrical and software problems were said to have made a 'hack'.</p>
          <p>This culture, documented by journalist Steven Levy in his 1984 book <em>'Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution'</em>, was built on a set of principles that became known as the <strong>Hacker Ethic</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Access to computers—and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works—should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!</li>
            <li>All information should be free.</li>
            <li>Mistrust authority—promote decentralization.</li>
            <li>Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.</li>
            <li>You can create art and beauty on a computer.</li>
            <li>Computers can change your life for the better.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This philosophy was foundational to the development of the early internet, open-source software, and the personal computer revolution.</p>

          <p><strong>L0pht Heavy Industries</strong> was a hacker collective and think tank founded in the 1990s in Boston, Massachusetts. Its members, including 'Mudge,' 'Weld Pond,' and 'Kingpin,' were pioneers in vulnerability research and responsible disclosure.</p>
          <p>On <strong>May 19, 1998</strong>, seven members of L0pht testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs. In a now-famous hearing, they warned about critical security vulnerabilities in the internet's infrastructure. Mudge, speaking for the group, made the audacious claim: 'We can, in fact, take down the Internet... [You can] take this as an absolute.' When asked how long it would take, he replied, 'About 30 minutes.'</p>
          <p>This testimony was a watershed moment, marking one of the first times that hackers were treated as expert witnesses rather than criminals by the government. It highlighted the fragility of the digital world and helped usher in an era where cybersecurity became a national security priority. L0pht also released widely used security tools like <strong>L0phtCrack</strong>, a password auditor that demonstrated the weakness of Windows NT passwords.</p>

          <p>Founded in 1984 in Lubbock, Texas, the <strong>Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc)</strong> is one of the oldest and most influential hacker groups. Originating in the BBS era, the cDc blended technical skill with media-savvy stunts and political commentary.</p>
          <p>In 1996, the cDc coined the term <strong>'hacktivism'</strong> to describe using hacking to promote political and social causes. They created the 'Hacktivismo' declaration, which asserted a right to access information online as a fundamental human right.</p>
          <p>The group is perhaps most famous for releasing <strong>Back Orifice (BO)</strong> at DEF CON 6 in 1998. Named as a pun on Microsoft's BackOffice Server, it was a remote administration tool that could be used for system administration but also for malicious purposes, granting near-total control over a remote Windows machine. The release was highly controversial, sparking a global conversation about dual-use security tools and corporate responsibility for software security.</p>

          <p>A central figure in the hacker culture at MIT's AI Lab in the 1970s, <strong>Richard Stallman (rms)</strong> became disillusioned as proprietary software began to replace the lab's open, collaborative environment. In 1983, he announced the <strong>GNU Project</strong>, an ambitious plan to create a complete, Unix-compatible operating system composed entirely of 'free software'.</p>
          <p>'Free software', as defined by Stallman, is about liberty, not price. It centers on four essential freedoms for users: the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software. To legally enforce these freedoms, he authored the <strong>GNU General Public License (GPL)</strong>, an innovative legal framework that ensures software and its derivatives remain free.</p>
          <p>Over the next decade, Stallman and a community of volunteers built key components of the GNU system, including the GCC compiler, the GDB debugger, and the Emacs editor. The final missing piece—the kernel—was filled by Linus Torvalds' Linux kernel in the early 1990s, leading to the creation of the <strong>GNU/Linux</strong> operating system used by millions today.</p>

          <p>Morris claimed his intention was not to cause damage but to gauge the size of the internet.

          <p>The incident served as a wake-up call. The cleanup required significant coordination and effort, leading directly to the formation of the first <strong>Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT/CC)</strong> at Carnegie Mellon University. Morris was convicted under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, making him the first person to be successfully prosecuted under the law.

        content: `
          <p>Written shortly after his arrest, the <strong>Hacker Manifesto</strong> is a short essay penned by Loyd Blankenship under the handle 'The Mentor.' It was published in 1986 in the ezine <strong>Phrack</strong> and quickly became one of the most widely quoted pieces of hacker literature.</p>
          <p>The text is a passionate defense of hacking, portraying hackers not as criminals, but as misunderstood explorers and learners. It captures the frustration of a generation of bright kids who felt stifled by a conformist, non-intellectual world. The opening lines are iconic: <em>"My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for."</em></p>
          <p>The Manifesto romanticizes the hacker as a digital anti-hero, driven by a thirst for knowledge and a desire for a world without arbitrary boundaries. It crystallized the feelings of many early hackers and served as a philosophical touchstone for the culture for decades to come, frequently cited in debates about ethics, motivation, and the spirit of hacking.</p>

        content: `
          <p><strong>Anonymous</strong> originated in the early 2000s on the /b/ (random) board of the imageboard website <strong>4chan</strong>. Initially, the name was simply a reference to the default 'Anonymous' user handle. It evolved into a shared identity for a leaderless, online community that coordinated pranks and raids on other websites for their own amusement ('for the lulz').</p>
          <p>The turning point for Anonymous came in 2008 with <strong>Project Chanology</strong>. The group launched a series of protests, pranks, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against the Church of Scientology after the Church attempted to censor a leaked video of Tom Cruise. This marked their transition from pranksters to politically motivated hacktivists.</p>
          <p>Since then, Anonymous has been associated with numerous high-profile operations, often in support of anti-censorship and anti-government control movements. Wearing the iconic Guy Fawkes mask (popularized by the film <em>V for Vendetta</em>), they have attacked government agencies, corporations, and religious groups. As a decentralized and fluid entity, anyone can claim to act in the name of Anonymous, making it a powerful but unpredictable force in the digital world.</p>

          <p>The <strong>Legion of Doom (LOD)</strong> was founded in 1984 by a hacker named Lex Luthor. It grew to become one of the most influential and technically skilled hacker groups of its time. Where many hackers focused on simple phreaking or software cracking, LOD members delved deep into the inner workings of telecommunications and computer systems.</p>
          <p>The group published the <strong>LOD Technical Journals</strong>, a series of ezines that contained detailed technical information on hacking, phone systems, and computer security, setting a new standard for information sharing in the underground. Membership was exclusive and based on proven technical ability, creating an elite aura around the group.</p>
          <p>LOD is famously known for its rivalry with the New York-based <strong>Masters of Deception (MOD)</strong>. The 'Great Hacker War' between the two groups was a clash of cultures and ethics. LOD was seen as the older, more professional, and technically focused group, while MOD was viewed as the younger, more chaotic upstarts. Many LOD members went on to have successful careers in the burgeoning cybersecurity industry, leveraging their deep technical knowledge for defensive purposes.</p>

          <p>In 1996, a programmer known as <strong>Solar Designer</strong> (Alexander Peslyak) released <strong>John the Ripper</strong>, a free, open-source password cracking tool. It quickly became one of the most popular and effective password security auditing tools available.</p>
          <p>Its primary purpose is to detect weak Unix passwords. However, its design is highly extensible, and over the years, it has been expanded to support hundreds of hash and cipher types on dozens of platforms. 'John,' as it's commonly known, uses a combination of techniques to crack passwords, including dictionary attacks, brute-force attacks, and hybrid attacks.</p>
          <p>The tool is a classic example of security software that can be used for both 'good' and 'bad' purposes. Security administrators use it to test the strength of their own systems' passwords and enforce better password policies. Attackers, on the other hand, can use it to gain unauthorized access. Its enduring popularity is a testament to its effective design and the ongoing challenge of password security.</p>

          <p>Discovered in 2010, <strong>Stuxnet</strong> was unlike any malware seen before. It was a highly advanced computer worm that targeted Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, which are used to control industrial processes.</p>
          <p>Its specific target was the Iranian nuclear program at Natanz. The worm was designed to infiltrate the facility's network and modify the behavior of Siemens PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) that controlled the centrifuges used to enrich uranium. Stuxnet would subtly increase and decrease the speed of the centrifuges, causing them to vibrate and eventually tear themselves apart. Simultaneously, it played back normal operating data to the controllers, so everything would appear fine until the physical damage was done.</p>
          <p>Attributed to a joint U.S. and Israeli intelligence operation, Stuxnet was the first publicly known example of a digital weapon causing large-scale physical destruction. It relied on multiple zero-day exploits and a sophisticated delivery mechanism, forever changing the landscape of international conflict and proving that code could be a weapon of war.</p>

          <p>The publications sparked a global debate. Supporters hailed WikiLeaks as a new form of investigative journalism and a vital check on government power. Critics accused it of recklessly endangering lives and undermining national security.

          <p>In May 2017, the <strong>WannaCry</strong> ransomware attack began spreading across the globe, crippling hospitals, corporations, and government agencies. As the world scrambled to react, a 22-year-old British security researcher named <strong>Marcus Hutchins</strong>, known online as 'MalwareTech,' made a crucial discovery.</p>
          <p>While analyzing the malware's code, Hutchins noticed it made a request to an unregistered, nonsensical domain name. On a hunch, he registered the domain for about $10. This simple act activated a 'kill switch' built into the malware by its creators, effectively halting the worm's rapid global spread. Hutchins was hailed as an accidental hero who saved countless systems from infection.</p>
          <p>However, his story took a twist months later when he was arrested by the FBI in Las Vegas after attending DEF CON. The charges related to his past involvement in writing banking malware years earlier. He eventually pleaded guilty to two charges and was sentenced to time served, with many in the security community advocating on his behalf. His story highlights the complex, often gray-hat world of malware research.</p>

        content: `
          <p><strong>Responsible Disclosure</strong> is an ethical framework that governs how to handle the discovery of a security vulnerability. Instead of publishing the flaw for all to see ('Full Disclosure') or keeping it secret, a researcher practicing responsible disclosure privately reports the vulnerability to the affected vendor. They then allow the vendor a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before publicizing any details.</p>
          <p>The concept emerged from debates in the 1990s and early 2000s. Early pioneers like the hackers at <strong>L0pht Heavy Industries</strong> pushed for this middle ground, arguing that it protected the public while pressuring companies to take security seriously. Initially, many companies were hostile, threatening legal action against researchers. However, the rise of <strong>bug bounty programs</strong>, pioneered by companies like Netscape, began to formalize and reward this process.</p>
          <p>The debate continues today. Some argue that any delay in disclosure leaves the public vulnerable, while others maintain that immediate full disclosure helps attackers more than defenders. Despite the controversy, responsible disclosure has become the dominant ethical model in the cybersecurity industry, shaping the relationship between hackers, vendors, and the public.</p>
